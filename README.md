## NOTE : THIS TOOL IS NOT READY FOR USE YET, IT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND PLANNING PHASE. THE STEPS BELOW WILL NOT WORK AND NOT MAKE SENSE.

### If you wish to contribute, then read the documentation for the code inside the 'whatswizard' directory.

This tool allows you to parse and analyze your WhatsApp chatlogs to uncover hidden patterns and insights.

## Features (upcoming, hopefully)

- Parses and cleans your WhatsApp chatlogs, removing any unnecessary information.
- Computes various statistical measures, such as the total number of messages, words, and characters in the chat.
- Generates visualizations, such as word clouds and line graphs, to help you understand and interpret the data.
- Exports the parsed and analyzed data to a CSV file for further analysis and visualization in other tools.



## Usage

1. Download and extract the tool.
2. Place your WhatsApp chatlogs (in text format) in the `input` directory.
3. Run the `parse.py` script to parse and clean the chatlogs.

python parse.py

4. Run the analyze.py script to compute the statistical measures and generate the visualizations.

python analyze.py

5. View the generated files in the output directory.
